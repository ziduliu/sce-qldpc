"""Initial program: lifted-product CSS code, ONE (group, shape) bed per
program, N_SLOTS (env CM_NSLOTS) freely-filled candidates per generation.

SEARCH SPACE (the only constraints; everything else is free):
- The group and the protograph shapes are fixed for the whole program
  (genotype, editable between generations). Each of the 20 slots fills
  the cells however it wants: PER SLOT, every cell holds 0..5 DISTINCT
  group elements (an empty cell is a zero block) - term counts AND
  elements are both the slot's choice. Identical fillings are
  deduplicated downstream and waste the slot.
- Size law: n = (ca*cb + ra*rb) * q for A of shape (ra, ca), B of shape
  (rb, cb), |G| = q. n must land in [CM_NMIN, CM_NMAX) (default
  [100, 600)); the scaffold picks the largest valid q.
- PER-SLOT validity (scaffold-checked; a violating slot is voided, not
  repaired): max row weight <= CM_WMAX (an HX row sums A-row i with
  B-column j; an HZ row sums a B-row with an A-column - check BOTH),
  no all-zero protograph row or column on either side (a zero A-row
  leaves its sector-2 block untouched by every Z check, which is a
  weight-1 logical - d=1 - unless the matching B column is a single
  1-term cell; symmetric for the other three cases), cells distinct,
  sizes 0..5.
- k > 0 required; k is measured on the built matrices per slot.

GROUPS: GTYPE "cyclic" (Z_q), "abelian" (Z_A0 x Z_{q/A0}) or "custom".
A custom group is a code string defining valid_q(q) -> bool and
custom_ops(q) -> dict(elements, ident, mul, inv). Any finite group you
can write down qualifies; the scaffold validates identity, inverses and
associativity on samples before building.

# REFUTED: The parent's degree-three allocations match its all-four-term proxy performance on this bed: every slot with idx%4!=0 had d2s<=36, and all five measured winners used four terms in every cell.
# REFUTED: The parent's six-trial component selection reliably prevents sub-50 logicals: slot 48 fell from d2s=67 to d30s=42, exposing a sector-1 Z witness confined to Bcol0 across both Acols.
# REFUTED: All-four-term supports with within-coset Sidon selection and component descent reliably exclude sub-30 logicals; the measured parent screened slots 18, 26 and 48 at 27, 24 and 21 respectively.
# REFUTED: Coupled full-coset quartics with persistent component information-set challenges uniformly exclude sub-30 logical readings; current horizontal slots 30 and 33 instead screened at 27 with k=295 and w=12.
